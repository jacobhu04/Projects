# Touch Grass - A 2D World Generation Game
## Overview
Touch Grass is a lighthearted 2-D game in which you control an avatar exploring a procedurally generated world. The goal is to touch all of the grass tiles to win. This project is inspired by the online joke where telling someone to "touch grass" humorously implies they need to go outside more often.

## Features
Procedural World Generation: The world layout is randomized based on a seed, allowing for reproducible worlds.

Save and Load Functionality: You can quit and reload the game, and the world will be in the same state as when you left it.

Winning Condition: The game ends when your avatar successfully touches all grass tiles in the world.

Game Illumination Toggle: Optional feature to toggle the illumination of the world for a challenge.

## How to Play
Choose a seed to generate a new world or load the previously saved game.

Control your avatar to explore the world and touch all grass tiles.

Toggle illumination of the world if desired.

Save your progress at any time.

Reload the game to continue from where you left off.

Win by successfully touching all grass tiles!
