# Touch Grass - A 2D World Generation Game

## Overview

Touch Grass is a lighthearted 2-D game in which you control an avatar exploring a procedurally generated world. The goal? Touch all of the grass tiles to win! This project is inspired by the online joke where telling someone to "touch grass" implies they need to go outside more often.

## Features

Procedural World Generation: The world layout is randomized based on a seed, allowing for reproducible worlds.

Save and Load Functionality: You can quit and reload the game, and the world will be in the same state as when you left it.

Winning Condition: The game ends when your avatar successfully touches all grass tiles in the world.

Control your avatar to explore the world and touch all grass tiles.

Toggle illumination of the world if desired.

Save your progress at any time.
