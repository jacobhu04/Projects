# Data Science and Programming Projects
This repository contains two distinct projects demonstrating my work in data science and programming.

## 1. Spam Email Classification (Logistic Regression Model)
In this project, I built a logistic regression model to classify emails as spam or ham (non-spam). The model leverages various features, including keyword indicators, email length, number of exclamation marks, and the presence of HTML tags, to classify emails.

### Key Features:

Text-based features (specific keywords, email length, exclamation marks, HTML tags)

Logistic Regression model

Evaluation metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC curve

Threshold tuning to balance precision and recall

### Technologies Used:

Python

Pandas, Scikit-learn, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 2. 2D World Generation Game
This project involves generating a 2D grid world where an avatar has to touch all the grass tiles to win the game. The game supports saving and reloading the world state, allowing users to navigate and interact with the environment.

### Key Features:

World grid generation with grass, obstacles, and empty spaces

Avatar navigation with movement in the grid

Saving and reloading game state


### Technologies Used:

Java

Basic game logic using random and NumPy

How to Run:

The game can be run directly by executing the main script (game.py).

You can interact with the game and use the arrow keys to navigate the avatar.

Save and reload world states to resume or alter the game environment.
